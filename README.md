# 🌍 Unsupervised Learning on Country Data

## 📘 Overview
The **Unsupervised Learning on Country Data** project applies various **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to **predict and classify countries into groups** based on their socio-economic and demographic characteristics.  
By using clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction, the project reveals meaningful patterns and similarities among countries that may not be immediately visible through raw data.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is **to predict and classify countries into distinct groups** according to their development indicators, economic performance, and social factors.  
Through clustering and dimensionality reduction, we can uncover hidden relationships and group countries that share similar traits, supporting deeper analysis and strategic decision-making.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used
This project utilizes multiple unsupervised learning algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods:
- 🔹 **K-Means Clustering**
- 🔹 **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**
- 🔹 **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**
- 🔹 **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** — for dimensionality reduction and visualization

These techniques help identify natural clusters and visualize country relationships in a simplified feature space.
